# Magma
Magma Engine is a rendering engine which I'm doing while I'm studying a Computer Graphics Masters Degree.

## Requirements
- OS: [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/windows) (Magma Engine only supports windows at this moment)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) (not strictly required, however included setup scripts at the moment only support this)

## Basic setup
Once you've cloned this repository using the command:

	git clone https://github.com/Frollo24/Magma

Run `Scripts/SetupVS2022.bat` if you're using Visual Studio 2022 to generate correct Visual Studio solution and project files.
